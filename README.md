My personal projects

KWIACIARNIA

Project that I created from the PSD to HTML/CSS. I have done it using Bootstrap3, because its grid was the best for this layout and I wanted to learn that framework.



One Million Lines

It is a project from the tutorial where I added my own features e.g. scroll.




Validation form

It is a project that I made using JS and jQuery to learn those programming languages.
